b. Write out an example algorithm of an every-day task: 
You go to put on some socks, and you find you only have a single sock in your drawer. The next step is:
1. Look under drawer to see if other sock has dropped down under there.
2. If not found there, look in laundry baskets to find missing sock.
3. If not found there, look in laundry machine where sock was washed and dried to find sock.
4. If still 404 sock not found error, wear another pair of socks, wear only one sock, or throw away useless single sock. 
5. End procedure and move on about the rest of your day.
