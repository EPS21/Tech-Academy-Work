-Blended learning - When you take classes in person versus online classes, blended learning is a combination of the two to try to get the best of both worlds of these learning environment. The Tech Academy is an example of blended learning.
-Online Advertising - The way companies pay to put ads on the internet, that appear in webpages and search results, as to hopefully gain your business or views. This is what keeps the servers running and an income to people who own and create these websites.
-Online photo sharing - The ability to upload your photos online, and share them among people in your social networks.

-Digital citizenship - The unofficial self-made concept among internet users, or netizens, that there are universal cultural norms in how you act when interacting with users on the internet, through message boards, social media, and in any place where people interact with each other in an online setting. These norms can change from website to website, like in facebook where its expected for people to be generally civil, as your real identity is tied to your username, or like in 4chan where everyone is anonymous, and trolling is an expected and sometimes even celebrated practice.
-Net neutrality - The concept that all data that goes across the internet and through ISP's, no matter what should be treated equally and unhinged by the gatekeepers of data that ISP's are. Net neutrality often comes up in debates when ISP's have an interest or own some websites and services, and have been known to throttle other existing and competing services so as to "encourage" internet users to switch to these faster services. Many people view this to be unfair when new and emerging web services come up but would have to pay the ISP to guarantee acceptable bandwidth to their site.
