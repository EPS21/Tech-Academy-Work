2.       write a simple function to check if the Binary Tree is a Binary Search Tree.

3.       Tic tac toe 3x3 solving

4.       Tic tac toe check winner

11.   Function to print the Factorial of a given number

12.   Most frequent number in an array

13.   Tow Sum Problem

14.   Most frequent element in an array

15.   Check whether the string is unique or not.

16.   Swap numbers without addl variable

17.   consider there is largest array

18.   char[] Input = new char[10000]; {a,b,\n,c,d,e,\n,f,g,\n,h,\n.........}

19.   char[] output = new char[4];

20.   find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters

21.   string s = "abcabcbb"  out put abc

22.   Write a function that parses an input buffer and sends output of the size of output array. We should also return the position of the input buffer and the size used in the output array.

When the input array has '/n' we should return it as '\r ' '\n' as two separate characters.

Do all the validation and check for edge cases.

       23. Design a data structure for Users and Groups in which

                 1.user will have some custom properties

                2.Groups will have custom properties and Users in the group.

                3.Groups can have multiple child groups and multiple parent groups.

                4.When you detect a loop in the parent child relation don't accept that.
