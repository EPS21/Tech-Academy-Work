			Dear Toli Leonovich (or Hiring Manager),</br></br></br>

			My name is Eric Sheng. I'm an experienced web developer with strong communication and organizational skills. This letter is regarding the Software Developer			
			position that I had come across in Integra's website listing.</br></br>
			
			I admire the company culture presented in the website, as a developer always looking to grow and expand knowledge myself in a positive working environment. 
			During my time with Prosper IT Consulting, I learned a lot working with my Scrum team during the development lifecycle and was an enjoyable time enhancing the application with others.</br></br>
			
			I know trying to find the right candidate can be difficult. Attached is my resume, and let me know if you think I'd be a good fit. I'd love to be a part of Integra and
			believe I could be a helpful addition to your team!</br></br></br>

			Thank you for your time.</br></br>
			Sincerely,</br>
			Eric
