Hi, I saw your listing for the junior position at Bad Rabbit, and I was moved by your what your company portrayed and its values, particularly with its transparency, and being fair and open. I also love dogs lol, and own an adorable chihuahua mix.

About myself, I'm an avid competitive gamer and I carry my passion to succeed in that hobby with my newfound passion of software development, always trying to min/max how my code runs and doing things efficiently, and during my bootcamp and internship helped build and enhance a web based application, as well doing code reviews as a team. Also I've done some IT consulting in the past, so I believe this we would be a great fit!

You can see some samples of my work here on my github: https://github.com/EPS21

Here's my resume too of course, and I hope to hear back from you guys soon!

Sincerely,
Eric Sheng
