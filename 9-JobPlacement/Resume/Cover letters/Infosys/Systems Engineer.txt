To the Hiring Manager,

Hello, my name is Eric Sheng and I'm an experienced web developer proficient in Microsoft’s .NET Framework with C#, and general full-stack web development.	

I admire the culture with Infosys and have a strong passion for solving problems for clients and creating solutions that work. Having worked in a small Agile/Scrum team myself creating a web application for a client, there's no greater joy than having deployed the finished product and I hope to have many more opportunities creating solutions with Infosys.

I know trying to find the right candidate can be difficult. Attached is my resume, and let me know if you think I'd be a good fit. I'd love to make a meaningful contribution and I think I could be a helpful addition to your team!

Thank you for your time.
Sincerely,
Eric
