To the Hiring Manager,

        Hello, I'm an experienced web developer with Java, .NET, and communication skills. This letter is regarding the Jr. Java developer 
position at PeopleTech Group.
	
	I admire that as a part of your hiring program you have an initiative to train freshers in several practices, and after having done
my internship at Prosper IT Consulting, I am extremely eager to learn more in this field with Microsoft, PeopleSoft, and BI practices!
			
	I know trying to find the right candidate can be difficult. Attached is my resume, and let me know if you think I'd be a good fit. I'd love to work with PeopleTech Group and I think I could be a helpful addition to your team!

Thank you for your time.
Sincerely,
Eric
