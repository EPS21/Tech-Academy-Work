To the Hiring Manager,

        Hello, I'm an experienced web developer with Java, .NET, and communication skills. This letter is regarding the .Net Developer 
position at KRG Tech.
	
	Having done many ASP.NET applications before, with C# as my language of choice and made many web apps in MVC, along with SQL queries and Entity Framework, I think my skills and experience would be an excellent fit for the job.
			
	I know trying to find the right candidate can be difficult. Attached is my resume, and let me know if you think I'd be a good fit. I'd love to work with KRG Tech and I think I could be a helpful addition to your team!

Thank you for your time.
Sincerely,
Eric
