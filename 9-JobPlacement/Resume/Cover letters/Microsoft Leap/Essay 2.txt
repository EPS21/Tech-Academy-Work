I have studied some programming before in my undergrad work, but recently really accelerated the pace that I wanted to learn, so I committed to the The Tech Academy's Full Stack Developer bootcamp in the beginning of this year. Since then, I have attended dozens of local meetups to interact with other developers, discover new tech and ways to become a better programmer. Not just in person, but online communities and spaces where it is easy to interact and tap into so much collective knowledge of other programmers. Also with so many resources, documentation, and tutorials available online I am always researching and learning to discover and implement functionality in my projects I didn't know was possible, or to solve a problem I want to achieve in my programs. This is how I've been exposing myself to programming thus far.
