I am interested in programming because of its far reaching effects on the world, and how it has so much potential to make society and lives for people better. To the technologies necessary to keep the fabric of society together, or to the little (but big!) things like video games and entertainment that make people happy, its all achieved through technology. And programming at all its level of languages, low to high, is the modern way of expression in today's with limitless potential to create better lives for all.

I used to teach English, and being a former teacher, I feel the greatest accomplishment and joy in my profession was making a positive influence with my students. However my reach in this regard had a physical restraint of my voice and the classroom, and how many classes I could teach per day. With programming, that reach is not constrained by the physical world, and I want to make a positive impact in the world.
