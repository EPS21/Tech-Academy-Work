	Dear Boeing Hiring Manager,</br></br></br>

	Hello, I'm an experienced web developer with strong .NET and Front-End web development skills, and having worked in an Agile team before. 
	This letter is regarding the Junior UI/UX Developer 
	position.</br></br>
	
	I have grown up most of my life in the PNW and I've known Boeing is synonymous with this area, and have always admired the aviatian industry they brought here. 
	With that I hope to apply my skills as a developer to make history with the world leader in aviation! You can see some samples of what I've worked on before
	<a href="https://github.com/EPS21/Projects">here</a>
	</br></br>
	
	I know trying to find the right candidate can be difficult. Attached is my resume and references, and let me know if you think I'd be a good fit. I'd love to work on 
	the front end and UI/UX with Boeing and I think I could be a helpful addition to your team!</br></br></br>

	Thank you for your time.</br></br>
	Sincerely,</br>
	Eric
