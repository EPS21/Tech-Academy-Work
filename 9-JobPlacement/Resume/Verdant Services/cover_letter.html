	To Verdant Services Hiring Manager,</br></br></br>

	Greetings, I'm an experienced developer with a strong focus on the .NET stack with C# and SQL Server most recently, and Java as well.
	This letter is regarding the Developer position that was referred by my two good friends who work here, 
	Paul Ostermann and JJ Vongpanya.</br></br>
	
	Based on what Paul and JJ have said, the company is growing quickly and in a great direction. 
	They tell me you work with many different clients in the food and beverage industry,
	working with and implementing software for the various needs of different clients. 
	Everyday seems like a unique challenge, which is an environment I would love to be a part of!</br></br>
	
	I know trying to find the right candidate can be difficult. Having worked in a Scrum / Agile team 
	previously in my internship utilizing some of the same framework and languages Verdant uses as well, 
	I believe I would be a great fit, and a helpful addition to your team!</br></br></br>

	Thank you for your time.</br></br>
	Sincerely,</br>
	Eric
