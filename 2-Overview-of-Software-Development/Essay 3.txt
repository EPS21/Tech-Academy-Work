DIGIT * (BASE ^ POSITION #)
This is the relationship between a digit, its base numbering system, and what position it has within a certain number of a specific numbering system. For example, in 3B in hexadecimal, The digit B is in position 0, so base 16 to the power of 0 is 1, times the digit B would be 11 * 1 = 11, so in the first position 0 there is a B (or 11).
