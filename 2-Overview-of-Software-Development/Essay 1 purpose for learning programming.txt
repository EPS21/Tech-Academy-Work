What is your purpose for learning computer programming?

To get a job and maybe work on some cool programming stuff like making games and stuff. Also I really like knowing how things we take for granted everyday work, from some little mechanical switch to cars, I've always had an interest in stuff like this and computers too, knowing how they work and how to be able to make programs would be really cool. I was just looking at the definition for what Abstract Data is, and the analogy of the cars brake system, how the average user does not need to be concerned with why it works, just how it works. But I've never been content knowing just how stuff works, and like to know all the why's as well.

My purpose for learning computer programming is to not only to make a decent living for myself, but to also work in the exciting technological field that is ever changing for the future, unlike in some other industries that are antiquated and their days are numbered. I also just enjoy knowing how things work, and we take for granted these devices we use everyday, with computers probably being the most important technological innovation of our time, so being literate in these devices and computer programming is truly the international language of today, which I find cool and hope we can make a better world for ourselves in this tiny little place called Earth. With computer programming the possibilities of what we can make to do for us is nearly limitless, only bound by our imagination. So that's why I want to learn how to do this. And it sure beats the other menial jobs I had in the past.
