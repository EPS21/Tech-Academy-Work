How can you use various algorithm sorting methods as a software developer?
You can use various algorithm sorting methods to organize raw data you might receive and then put it into more easily read and useful information. Whether sorting from lowest to highest, highest to lowest, or by some other means the various sorting algorithms may accomplish the same thing in the end, but their implementation is different for each, all with their advantages and disadvantages. For example, the selection sort requires another variable minPosition, which is another variable the other two don't have, however I think it may not have to traverse and iterate through the array as often as the others since it compares to the minPosition variable instead of every other element in the array, from my understanding of it. But either way depending on what and how large a set of data is, there will be an algorithm best suited for that data set.
