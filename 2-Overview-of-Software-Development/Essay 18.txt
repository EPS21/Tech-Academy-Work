First Generation (1GL) - The earliest machine code when people directly programmed the 1's and 0's into a computer.

Second Generation (2GL) - Assembly language that has more simple commands but represented as some words and characters. Assembly is then converted into machine language.

Third Generation (3GL) - These are the first higher level languages, that has actual words and commands to instead of just numbers and characters to program with, which have easier to understand syntax.

Fourth Generation (4GL) - Higher level languages that even closer represent human languages, these languages are typically used to access databases like SQL.

Fifth Generation (5GL) - Some sort of experimental programming languages used in neural networks and AI, to imitate how the human mind works.
