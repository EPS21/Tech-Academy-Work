1. What is hexadecimal and how can you use it as a developer?
Hexadecimal is a base 16 numbering system, and it seems to be a way to convert the often hard to read binary code, because everything but the smallest quantities are represented as a big long string of ones and zeros, so hexadecimal helps to shorten the amount of characters used and thus, make some numbers in the code a little more clear to a developer to read than binary.
2. Convert the following hexadecimal to decimal:
2A = 42
9F = 159
101D = 4125
3. Convert the following hexadecimal to binary:
3B = 111011
4F = 1001111
96E = 100101101110
