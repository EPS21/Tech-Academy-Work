I learned how project management, connecting to remote server repositories and connecting your own projects via github in Visual Studio worked. It seems like a pretty powerful IDE, and the intellisense helps you out when programming and letting you know when there's an error. And when it makes the scaffolding code for you is convenient, and being able to step through your code with the break points I can see being really useful in debugging your code when it doesn't behave how you like it to. Although it is much more cumbersome resource wise and figuring out its UI takes more work than the other editors like notepad++, it's features are powerful and can streamline a lot of projects, both individual and group ones. So I imagine in the workplace developers use this or and IDE similar to it so everyone can collaborate efficiently on a project.
