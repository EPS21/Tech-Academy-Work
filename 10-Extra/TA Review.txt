My time at the The Tech Academy in Seattle was enjoyable and thorough. It is smaller than their main campus in Portland, and I was amongst the first group of just 4 or 5 students beginning there on their opening, I believe its grown some since then but its a smaller environment so you can get some more personalized attention, especially compared to the bigger bootcamps.

The Tech Academy and it's staff care about your success, and will help you as much as they can in order to succeed in both the curriculum and afterwards. For me I had planned on trying to finish the bootcamp a little quicker to go on a trip before the summer, but things happened and they were kind enough to make an exception, but overall it will be the best benefit to do the content thoroughly and at as fast as pace as possible.

Content wise, overall it is very good, and is updated often, there was some restructure as I did it before they split it into these more specific C#/Python tracts. It could be different now, but I do wish there was more emphasis on Algorithms, especially considering many companies interview based on your knowledge of such things, and problem solving as you go through the interview rounds.

Coding is not easy, finding your first job is especially not easy, but the Tech Academy will give you the right foundation and they do really want you to succeed. Since the campus in Seattle is newer and not as established, they don't have as many connections to local companies as say, their main one in Portland.
