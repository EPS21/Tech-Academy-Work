-Aggregate functions - these functions allow you to perform a calculation on a set of values to get a singular value in the end. For example, the COUNT function will count up how many values in a column and give back how many it counted up.
-AND - lets you choose more than one thing
-AS - Lets you rename a field or table to another name
-ASC - ascending order
-CLAUSE - statements like WHERE, a conditional clause so that only certain data is retrieved
-COUNT - counts the number of values
-DESC - descending order
-DISTINCT - use this in a select statement to eliminate duplicate rows
-FROM - use this to tell your dbms from what table you are selecting and working with in your statement
-GROUP BY - This lets you do aggregate functions and group the result set by certain columns
-HAVING - similar to WHERE clause, but lets you do it with aggregate functions
-LIKE - when you need to search or compare values that are the same or similar, often used with wildcards
-NULL - when an element in the table has nothing in it, it is null
-OR - the conditional statement in a WHERE clause which displays a record if a condition between the OR statement is true
-ORDER BY - this is how you sort by a certain column, usually with ASC or DESC order appended to it
-SELECT - the basic statement in order to point to values in a table and display them
-VALUES - when using insert into and probably some other statements, you'll use VALUES to denote what values you are inserting into your table(s)
-WHERE - the WHERE clause is how to filter records and only obtain ones fulfilling a certain condition you specify.
