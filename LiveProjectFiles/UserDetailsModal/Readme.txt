Product Backlog Item 141: UI - Update the Admin User Details Modal to actually contain the data in an organized fashion

Description: When first selecting the Admin panel, a list of users is displayed.  Clicking on "Details" next to each user pops up a modal that contains data.  that Data is poorly contained inside the modal. Make it so all data is inside the modal. 

The previously written Ajax call was overridding elements in the details modal such as the header and footer, so I had to rewrite the call to be properly contained within the modal body, and using a dynamic identifier (as the number of users on that list can change and is not static), when clicked calls the ajax function which will fill in the users data into a table format by using a partial view, and then open the modal so one can view more details about this user without having redirect to another page, creating a better user experience.
